## Research Areas

### Adaptive Accessibility

 * An approach to improving the accessibility of ICTs that acknowledges and responds to the fact that our capabilities are both dynamic and influenced by many factors.
 * Developing techniques to bridge traditional assistive technologies and mainstream systems, in order to afford adaptive accessibility for a wider audience.
 * Using this to sustain the autonomy of older people using ICTs.

### Accessible Gaming

Games that are playable by people with disabilities but--more than that--promote social inclusion by allowing disabled gamers to take part in

 * playing games co-operatively and competitively,
 * modifying games,
 * and creating new maps/levels for the games.

### Information Retrieval and Document Accessibility

Counteracting "information overload" by presenting people with specific information in which they're interested in a way that is easy for them to perceive.
